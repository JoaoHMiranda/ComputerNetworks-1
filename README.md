# Redes-de-Computadores-1

This repository contains simulation programs for Ethernet packet transmission, developed as part of a Computer Networks course. The project demonstrates process creation, inter-process communication via shared memory, and simple collision detection in an Ethernet-like environment.

## Overview

The repository includes two versions of the Ethernet simulator:

- **EthernetSimulator1.c**  
  Multiple child processes continuously attempt to send packets through a shared cable. Each process generates random Ethernet packets and uses shared memory to simulate the transmission medium. Collision detection is performed by verifying that the packet stored in shared memory matches the packet generated by the process.

- **EthernetSimulator2.c**  
  In this version, a number of child processes are created that remain idle while the parent process continuously sends Ethernet packets through the shared cable. The mechanism for packet creation, transmission, and collision detection is similar to the first version.

## Features

- **Random Packet Generation:**  
  Each packet includes randomly generated source and destination MAC addresses, a type field, and a data payload.

- **Shared Memory Communication:**  
  Simulates an Ethernet cable by allowing multiple processes to communicate through shared memory.

- **Collision Detection:**  
  Validates the integrity of the transmitted packet by comparing the shared memory content with the generated packet.

- **Process Synchronization:**  
  Implements a simple lock mechanism using a flag in shared memory to manage access to the simulated cable.
